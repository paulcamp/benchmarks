# Introduction
Many places in production code require decisions - usually checking if a value is a member of a set of values.
This benchmark proves which method is the fastest.  

## Benchmarking plain if / then / else and alternatives
* using plain 'if / then / else logic
* maps can make the code look more elegant. Utilising default values (bool defaults to false) means anything not declared in the map will give false by default.
* case statements can combine all the comparisons into a single line that's more readable




## Results

â€¢ benchmark results were obtained using go version 1.20.3 on Apple M1 (Pro) Silicon

1st column shows number of operations made in 1 second  
2nd column shows nanoseconds per operation (where operation is a func call)  
4th column shows number of heap allocations  
**case statements** win in terms of speed.
